Hi)  
My name is Lisa and now I'm not scared about using git  
But I was  
And it is really exciting for me because Â I  often heard smt like "I make a commitment" but don't understand how it works  
And this small thing gives me filing like I can learn anything that I don't have before  
So I'm really gratful your community for this inspiration and I hope that I have a chance to continue my education with you <3
